# Achievement System Implementation
*Created: 2025-11-17*
*Status: ✅ Complete*

- No manual refresh needed

---

## Integration with Cloud Functions

### Server-Side Detection

Cloud Function `detectAchievements` (from Phase 1):
- Triggers on student stats update
- Checks all achievement thresholds
- Awards new achievements
- Sends push notification to parents
- Updates student document

### Client-Side Display

When notification received:
1. Local notification appears
2. Parent opens app
3. Achievement unlocked popup shows
4. Achievement added to "Earned" tab
5. Badge unlocked in "All Achievements" grid

### Achievement Check Logic

```dart
AchievementTemplates.checkAchievementsForStats(
  currentStreak: 8,
  totalBooksRead: 12,
  totalMinutesRead: 450,
  totalReadingDays: 15,
  earnedAchievementIds: ['five_books', 'week_streak'],
);
// Returns: ['ten_books'] - ready to unlock!
```

---

## User Experience Flow

### Parent Perspective

**Discovery**:
1. Child reads for 7 days straight
2. Cloud Function detects streak achievement
3. Push notification: "Emma earned new achievements! 🎉 Week Warrior"
4. Parent taps notification
5. App opens to achievement unlock popup
6. Celebration animation plays
7. Parent taps "Awesome!"
8. Achievement appears in "Earned" tab

**Exploration**:
1. Parent navigates to Achievements screen
2. Sees 3 earned achievements
3. Taps "All Achievements" tab
4. Sees 19 total achievements (16 locked)
5. Taps locked "Monthly Master"
6. Sees progress: "8 / 30 days (27%)"
7. Motivates child to continue reading!

### Student Perspective (future feature)

When student companion app exists:
- See own achievements
- Set personal goals
- Share achievements with friends (moderated)
- Unlock special Lumi moods

---

## Motivation Psychology

### Why Achievements Work

**1. Goal Gradient Effect**:
- Seeing "8 / 30 days" creates urgency
- Closer to goal = more motivated

**2. Collection Completionism**:
- Seeing locked badges creates "need to collect all"
- Grid view shows gaps in collection

**3. Variable Reward Schedule**:
- Don't know when next achievement unlocks
- Creates anticipation and excitement

**4. Social Proof** (future):
- Comparing with classmates (opt-in)
- Leaderboards drive friendly competition

**5. Progress Visualization**:
- Progress bars show concrete advancement
- Small wins (common) early, big wins (legendary) later

---

## Rarity Distribution

### Intentional Difficulty Curve

```
Common (Bronze):     5-10 books, 300 min, 10 days    → Early wins
Uncommon (Silver):   7-14 streak, 10 books, 600 min  → Moderate effort
Rare (Gold):         14 streak, 25 books, 1500 min   → Significant achievement
Epic (Purple):       30 streak, 50 books, 3000 min   → Very dedicated
Legendary (Rainbow): 100 streak, 100 books, 6000 min → Elite readers
```

**Design Principle**: Early frequent rewards (common/uncommon) build habit, rare rewards provide long-term goals.

---

## Extensibility

### Adding New Achievements

**Step 1**: Add to `AchievementTemplates`:

```dart
{
  'id': 'genre_explorer',
  'name': 'Genre Explorer',
  'description': 'Read books from 5 different genres!',
  'icon': '🎭',
  'category': 'genre',
  'rarity': 'rare',
  'requiredValue': 5,
  'requirementType': 'genres',
}
```

**Step 2**: Update Cloud Function logic:

```typescript
// Add genre tracking to reading logs
// Check genre diversity in detectAchievements
```

**Step 3**: Test:

```dart
AchievementTemplates.getTemplate('genre_explorer');
```

### Custom School Achievements

**Future Feature**: Allow schools to create custom achievements:
- School-specific challenges
- Reading month events
- Custom thresholds (e.g., "Read 10 books about dinosaurs")

**Data Model**:
```dart
{
  'id': 'custom_winter_reading_challenge',
  'schoolId': 'oakwood-primary',
  'name': 'Winter Reading Star',
  'description': 'Read 5 books during December!',
  ...
}
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Firestore Reads

**Efficient Queries**:
- Single document read for student data
- Achievements embedded in student document (no separate collection)
- StreamBuilder caches data locally

**Optimization**:
```dart
// GOOD: Reads student doc once
StreamBuilder<DocumentSnapshot>(
  stream: studentRef.snapshots(),
  ...
)

// BAD: Would read all achievements separately
// (Not our implementation)
```

### UI Performance

**Lazy Loading**:
- Only renders visible achievement cards
- ListView builder for "Earned" tab
- GridView builder for "All" tab

**Animation Performance**:
- Animations only on first 5 items
- Shimmer effects use GPU
- No jank on low-end devices

---

## Testing

### Model Tests

```dart
test('AchievementTemplates.checkAchievementsForStats detects new achievements', () {
  final newAchievements = AchievementTemplates.checkAchievementsForStats(
    currentStreak: 7,
    totalBooksRead: 10,
    totalMinutesRead: 600,
    totalReadingDays: 15,
    earnedAchievementIds: [],
  );

  expect(newAchievements.length, equals(5)); // Should unlock 5 achievements
  expect(newAchievements.any((a) => a['id'] == 'week_streak'), isTrue);
  expect(newAchievements.any((a) => a['id'] == 'ten_books'), isTrue);
});
```

### Widget Tests (future)

```dart
testWidgets('AchievementUnlockPopup shows correct rarity color', (tester) async {
  final achievement = AchievementModel(
    rarity: AchievementRarity.legendary,
    ...
  );

  await tester.pumpWidget(AchievementUnlockPopup(achievement: achievement));

  final container = find.byType(Container).first;
  final decoration = tester.widget<Container>(container).decoration as BoxDecoration;

  expect((decoration.gradient as LinearGradient).colors.first,
    equals(Color(0xFFFF1493).withOpacity(0.3)));
});
```

## Analytics & Insights

### Metrics to Track

**Achievement Unlock Rate**:
```
Average achievements per student
Most common first achievement
Time to first achievement
```

**Motivation Indicators**:
```
Reading increase after unlocking achievement
Correlation: Achievement unlocks → Reading minutes
Drop-off: Students who stop earning achievements
```

**Rarity Distribution**:
```
% Students with Legendary achievements
Most unlocked achievement
Least unlocked achievement
```

### Firebase Analytics Events

```dart
// Track achievement unlocks
FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logEvent(
  name: 'achievement_unlocked',
  parameters: {
    'achievement_id': 'week_warrior',
    'rarity': 'uncommon',
    'category': 'streak',
    'student_id': studentId,
  },
);
```

---

## Accessibility

### Current Implementation

- ✅ High contrast rarity colors
- ✅ Clear text labels
- ✅ Icon + text (not icon alone)
- ✅ Touch targets ≥ 48x48dp

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Screen reader support (Semantics)
- [ ] VoiceOver: "Week Warrior achievement, uncommon rarity, earned"
- [ ] Haptic feedback on unlock
- [ ] Reduced motion mode (disable animations)

---

## Localization Ready

### Hardcoded Text to Extract

```dart
// Achievement names & descriptions in templates
// Can be moved to translation files:
'Week Warrior' → AppLocalizations.of(context)!.achievementWeekWarrior
'Read for 7 days in a row!' → AppLocalizations.of(context)!.achievementWeekWarriorDesc
```

### Multi-Language Support

```json
// en.json
{
  "achievement_week_warrior": "Week Warrior",
  "achievement_week_warrior_desc": "Read for 7 days in a row!"
}

// es.json
{
  "achievement_week_warrior": "Guerrero Semanal",
  "achievement_week_warrior_desc": "¡Lee durante 7 días seguidos!"
}
```
